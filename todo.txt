Example App
- UI scrollable infinite Button list
- Buttons
  - animate button clicks
  - different color when button is for the selected model
- mouse dragging
- animating "bones"
- metadesk for asset files
  - Create all path strings at initialization
  - Create enums for these paths
  - What if the path must be dynamically determined ? (eg., User provides file)
- More efficient rendering of text.
  - Since we are rendering to a backubuffer we only need to do this once
  - Instead of passing one quad for the buffer we could pass smaller quads with the written to
    regions, this could be inferred from the vertices set up in Buttons.
    Therefore, we can probably merge those shaders into one draw call.

Misc
- metadesk for build targets

Base
- tag calls with callstack

x Build buttons and render after.
